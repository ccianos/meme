<P ALIGN="CENTER">Preamble
<P>The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may be copied, such that the Copyright
Holder maintains some semblance of artistic control over the development of the package, while giving the users
of the package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right
to make reasonable modifications.</P>
<P>Definitions:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>&quot;Package&quot; refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives
	of that collection of files created through textual modification.
	<P>
	<LI>&quot;Standard Version&quot; refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified in
	accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder.
	<P>
	<LI>&quot;Copyright Holder&quot; is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package.
	<P>
	<LI>&quot;You&quot; is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this Package.
	<P>
	<LI>&quot;Reasonable copying fee&quot; is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost, duplication charges,
	time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to
	the computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)
	<P>
	<LI>&quot;Freely Available&quot; means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there may be fees involved
	in handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they
	received it.

restriction, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.</P>
<P>2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived from the Public Domain or from
the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.</P>

	said modifications to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site such
	as ftp.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the Standard Version of the
	Package.</P>
	<P>b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.</P>
	<P>c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with standard executables, which must also
	be provided, and provide a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how it
	differs from the Standard Version.</P>
	<P>d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

	page or equivalent) on where to get the Standard Version.</P>
	<P>b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the Package with your modifications.</P>
	<P>c) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding Standard Version executables, giving the
	non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly documenting the differences in manual pages (or equivalent),
	together with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.</P>
	<P>d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.</P>
